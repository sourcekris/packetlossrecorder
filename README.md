# packetlossrecorder

Program to monitor internet connectivity in Windows and track it
over time.

Created because one night my ISP was dropping out and I wanted to
get an idea of the frequency and duration of the dropouts.

I didn't have a need to ping other hosts but one idea for improvement
would be to take a target on the command line.

### To Build

```
go build packetlossrecorder.go
```
